### Peer Review Assignment 1
This assignment was a simple introduction to implementing a UIButton and giving it an action. When the button is clicked, we get a message stating, "It worked!"


### Peer Review Assignment 2
A simple conversion app that converts inches to either feet, yards, or meters.


### Peer Review Assignment 3
A conversion app that converts U.S. Dollar amounts to EUR, PLN, and CZK through the use of the [CurrencyRequest Pod](https://github.com/samkaufman/CurrencyRequest) to make such conversions simpler.


### Peer Review Assignment 4
This app asks the user for a starting location, and then three possible destinations. Through the use of the [DistanceGetter Pod](https://github.com/samkaufman/DistanceGetter), the app then returns the distance between the starting location and each destination in kilometers.


### TwitterShare
This app opens up to what looks like a notepad with default text which can be edited. Once the user has input what he/she would like, and granted that the simulator is signed into a twitter and/or facebook account, the text will be posted to their twitter or facebook account. If the message is too long for twitter, the user will be notified. If the simulator is not signed into a twitter or facebook, the user will be notified upon trying to share as well.
